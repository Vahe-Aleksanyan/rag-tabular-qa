Invoice **I1004** (client **C001**) was issued on **2024-03-20** and its status is **Paid**. Both invoices are in **USD**. |
| [task_questions] Which invoices are currently marked as "Overdue"? | Mode: deterministic. rows=9. time=5.47s (router=1.66s, sql=0.01s, synth=3.80s). repair=no.

| [task_questions] For each service_name in InvoiceLineItems, how many line items are there? | Mode: deterministic. rows=8. time=3.74s (router=1.97s, sql=0.01s, synth=1.76s). repair=no.

For Acme Corp, the invoices returned are I1001 (invoice date 2024-01-10, due 2024-02-10, status Paid), I1004 (invoice date 2024-03-20, due 2024-04-20, status Paid), and I1022 (invoice date 2024-10-15, due 2024-11-14, status Paid). All of these invoices are in USD. See the table for the exact records and fields as returned by the query. |

See the table for the full invoice details returned by the query. |
| [task_questions] For invoice I1001, list all line items with service name, quantity, unit price, tax rate, and compute the line total (including tax) for each. | Mode: deterministic. rows=3. time=3.88s (router=2.11s, sql=0.02s, synth=1.75s). repair=no.

| [task_questions] For each client, compute the total amount billed in 2024 (including tax) across all their invoices. | Mode: deterministic. rows=20. time=9.38s (router=3.20s, sql=0.01s, synth=6.16s). repair=no. The SQL results already provide, for each client, the computed total billed including tax in the `total_billed_including_tax` column—see table for the exact amounts per client. Based on these rows, Acme Corp has the highest total billed including tax, followed by Vertex Analytics and BlueSky Consulting. The remaining clients are listed in descending order of `total_billed_including_tax` in the table. If you need any additional breakdown (e.g., by invoice or by month), that would require different query output than what’s shown here. |
| [task_questions] Which client has the highest total billed amount in 2024, and what is that total? | Mode: deterministic. rows=1. time=5.17s (router=2.11s, sql=0.01s, synth=3.05s). repair=no. Acme Corp (client_id C001) has the highest total billed amount for the year filtered in the query. The total billed including tax is 6830.000000000000 (see table for the exact formatting/precision). No other clients appear in the provided result rows, so I can’t compare beyond this top entry. |
| [task_questions] Across all clients, which three services generated the most revenue in 2024? Show the total revenue per service. | Mode: deterministic. rows=3. time=5.05s (router=2.09s, sql=0.01s, synth=2.95s). repair=no. The top three services by total revenue (including tax) are Court Appearance, M&A Advisory, and Tax Planning. Their total revenues (including tax) are shown in the table for each service. These results are aggregated across all clients based on the invoice line items matched by the query filter. |
| [task_questions] Which invoices are overdue as of 2024-12-31? List invoice ID, client name, invoice_date, due_date, and status. | Mode: deterministic. rows=7. time=8.60s (router=1.99s, sql=0.01s, synth=6.60s). repair=no. As of 2024-12-31, the overdue invoices returned by the query are shown in the table. They include invoice IDs I1002 (Bright Legal), I1005 (GreenField Retail), I1009 (Urban Tech), I1013 (Alpine Hospitality), I1015 (Pacific Foods), I1020 (Aurora Textiles), and I1028 (Nova Health). For each, the invoice_date, due_date, and status are listed in the table, and the status is “Overdue” for all returned rows. |
| [task_questions] Group revenue by client country: for each country, compute the total billed amount in 2024 (including tax). | Mode: deterministic. rows=15. time=7.19s (router=3.34s, sql=0.02s, synth=3.84s). repair=no. Total billed amount including tax is highest in the USA at 22003.000000000000. Next are the UK (7420.000000000000) and Ireland (6106.000000000000). Australia (5757.500000000000), Norway (5506.000000000000), and Portugal (5104.000000000000) follow. The remaining countries and their totals are shown in the table. |
| [task_questions] For the service "Contract Review", list all clients who purchased it and the total amount they paid for that service (including tax). | Mode: deterministic. rows=0. time=4.61s (router=2.28s, sql=0.02s, synth=2.32s). repair=no. I couldn’t find any matching records for the service “Contract Review” in the query results, so there are no clients or totals to report from this data. This could mean there were no invoice line items with that exact service name for the specified year, or the service name is recorded differently. Try running the same query without the year filter, or check for alternate spellings/capitalization (e.g., “Contract review” or “Contract Review -”). You could also search for similar service names and rerun the report. |
| [task_questions] Considering only European clients, what are the top 3 services by total revenue (including tax) in H2 2024 (2024-07-01 to 2024-12-31)? | Mode: deterministic. rows=3. time=6.49s (router=2.69s, sql=0.01s, synth=3.78s). repair=no. For European clients, the top services by total revenue (including tax) are **Custom Reporting**, **Regulatory Compliance Audit**, and **Tax Planning**. Their total revenue (including tax) values are shown in the table for each of these services. This result reflects only the invoices within the date range specified in your query and the included European countries filter. |
| [paraphrases] Show me customers and their industries. | Mode: deterministic. rows=20. time=4.28s (router=1.96s, sql=0.01s, synth=2.31s). repair=no.
